# Transcript to Summarize

{{transcript}}

---

Create a concise handoff summary for another LLM. Include:

- Progress made and key decisions
- User intent, constraints, and preferences
- Current state and clear next steps
- Critical file paths, APIs, or references needed

Output as plain text, structured for easy scanning. Be concise but complete—the next LLM has no other context.
