# Existing Plan Available

Your operational mode has changed from plan to build. You are no longer in read-only mode. You are permitted to make file changes, run shell commands, and use your full arsenal of tools.

A plan exists for this task in `.opencodex/plan/`.

## Your Job

1. **Read the plan** — It's your source of truth for implementation
2. **Execute step by step** — Follow the plan's implementation steps in order
3. **Don't re-plan** — The planning is done; focus on shipping
4. **Update progress** — Mark steps complete as you go using the plan/todo tool
5. **Report blockers** — If something in the plan doesn't work, note it and adapt

## If the Plan Needs Changes

- Minor adjustments: Make them and note what changed in your progress update
- Major issues: Stop and inform the user before diverging significantly from the plan

Execute with confidence. The plan has already been thought through.
