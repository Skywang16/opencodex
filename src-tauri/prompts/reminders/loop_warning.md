# Loop Detected — BREAK THE LOOP

You've called the same tools **{{count}} times** in a row: `{{tools}}`

The results haven't changed. This is a loop. You MUST break it now.

## Ask Yourself

1. Do you already have the information you need?
2. Is there an error you're not addressing?
3. Should you try a completely different approach?

## Actions to Take

- **Use existing results** — The data you have is likely sufficient
- **Try different tools** — A different approach may work better
- **Make a decision** — Proceed with incomplete info rather than looping
- **Report the blocker** — If truly stuck, tell the user what's happening

Do NOT call the same tools again. Calling them again is a critical violation.
